        Cloud-COPASI is not provided with any warranty, either expressed or implied. The software is currently in Beta, and it is likely that bugs still exist. Cloud-COPASI has the potential to launch chargeable-resources on Amazon Web services. It is your responsibility to monitor your AWS account using the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?#">AWS management console</a> when launching or terminating resources to ensure that you are not inadvertently charged for resources you did not intend to run. We take no responsibility for AWS resources that are inadvertently launched, or do not terminate as requested.
